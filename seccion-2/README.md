## Topics
- Callbacks: It's a function that is passed as an argument to another function, to be “called back” at a later time.
- Factory functions: A factory function is any function which is not a class or constructor that returns a (presumably new) object.
- Adapter Pattern: The adapter pattern acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces. This pattern involves a single class called adapter which is responsible for joining functionalities of independent or incompatible interfaces.
- Dependency Injection: Dependency Injection is a technique in which an object receives other objects that it depends on. These other objects are called dependencies.
- Promises: A promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.
- Async/Await: The async function declaration defines an asynchronous function, which returns an AsyncFunction object. The await expression causes async function execution to pause until a Promise is settled (that is, fulfilled or rejected), and to resume execution of the async function after fulfillment.
