## Topics
- Callbacks: It's a function that is passed as an argument to another function, to be “called back” at a later time.
- Factory functions: A factory function is any function which is not a class or constructor that returns a (presumably new) object.
- Adapter Pattern: The adapter pattern acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces. This pattern involves a single class called adapter which is responsible for joining functionalities of independent or incompatible interfaces.
- Dependency Injection: Dependency Injection is a technique in which an object receives other objects that it depends on. These other objects are called dependencies.
- Promises: A promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.
- Async/Await: The async function declaration defines an asynchronous function, which returns an AsyncFunction object. The await expression causes async function execution to pause until a Promise is settled (that is, fulfilled or rejected), and to resume execution of the async function after fulfillment.
- Winston: Winston is a logger for just about everything. It is designed to be a simple and universal logging library with support for multiple transports.
- Logger: A logger is a program that receives log messages and stores them in a way that makes them easy to manage.
- Testing: It's a process of evaluating a system or its components with the intent to find whether it satisfies the specified requirements or not.
- Jest Testing: It's a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.
- NodeJs + Typescript Testing: We can use `jest` to test our NodeJs application written in TypeScript.
- Coverage: It's a measure used to describe the degree to which the source code of a program is executed when a particular test suite runs.

### Unit Testing

Focuses on testing individual units of code in isolation from the rest of the application. It helps to ensure that the code is doing what it is supposed to do.

### Integration Testing

Focuses on testing the interaction between different units of code. It helps to ensure that the units of code work together as expected.
